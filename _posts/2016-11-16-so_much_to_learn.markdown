Is my brain even big enough to learn everything that I need to know about coding, in order to get a position in the industry? I have no idea, but I guess I will find out. Here I am, stuck on HTML, probaly the simplest of all in the coding world, but to me, it's a mountain. Like I said before, the only experience I have in HTML was back in the days of Xanga and myspace. 

But you know what? There are so many sources out there to help on the coding journey. Here are some of the things I am finding helpful:

First of all, I think that immersing yourself into code can really help, so I have been listening to a podcast about being new in code. It's called CodeNewbie. You can find it here: http://www.codenewbie.org/podcast
Listening to this podcast has already given me a lot of insight as to what to expect from code. It helps me to not get discouraged when I am stuck. It gives me the motivation to learn code, and I think that it will give me confidence for when I am out searching for my first job in tech. 

Second, there is a whole world out there to help you learn. Right now, as I am trying to build an HTML site from scratch (which I don't feel like I am ready to do), I have been supplied a link about developer tools. https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/chrome-dev-tools-markup-and-style--net-27149
Things like this, are here to help everyone on their coding journey. While I don't feel like I even know enough about code to start talking techniqually in this blog, there are so many resources out there that can help me get there. One day I will look back at these blog posts and see how far I have really come. I can't even wait. But for now, I need to drown in my notes, and look up every thing I need in order to put this HTML website together by myself, as well as the CSS.

That's all for today. Hopefully my blogs will become more tecniqual as I start to learn more and become more comfortable as a coder. My future career depends on it.
