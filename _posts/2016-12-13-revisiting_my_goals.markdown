So here I am, smack dab in the middle of my Procedural Ruby lessons. I finally feel like I am making headway, learning about loops, arrays, and all of the methods that can be applied to arrays. I am starting to finally be able to devote more time to learning code, and feeling very proud of myself for coding seven days in a row and for doing 35 lessons so far this past week! (This week was a different story, since I had to go out of town and leave my poor, lonely computer behind.)

Now that I am back from out of town, my goals are to code at least a little bit every day (a couple hours each night), and spend most of my weekends with my head in code. I want to change my life. I want to learn this and start a new career! I am currently trying to balance a full-time research job with learning to code, so I am on my computer at home about 14 hours a day, so it is going to take a lot of dedication, but I am determined to do it. This week, I am hoping to code and do a couple of lessons at least every day, and focus on a lot of coding this weekend. I want to get on and get through procedural Ruby as soon as I can.
