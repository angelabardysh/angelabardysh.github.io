Here I go again, hinting at my age. Yes, I had a MySpace back in the day, but what dates me even more is that I had a Xanga. Does anyone even know what Xanga was these days? Does Xanga even exist any more? If it does, I am sure there are some gems of a blog post under my old username, Middlebelt, if my memory serves me correctly. Well, let's just say these two sites tought me all I know about HTML, which isn't much. 

I remember listening to music and playing around with the HTML in order to get my page to look perfect. I mean, it had to look perfect for all of my visitors (like all 10 of them). I would change backgrounds, upload pictures, and play around with the font, and colors. Fast forward to today, I have a vague memory of HTML, which has come in handy for the first few labs. I am really excited about learning more about the development of a website, and embeding more advanced things into my websites. 

So for now, that is all I have to say about HTML, but I know that once I get a grasp on it, I will be able to build on it more. I can't wait to learn and do more.
