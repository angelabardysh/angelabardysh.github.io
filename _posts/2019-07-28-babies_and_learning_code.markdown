Life is getting crazy, but it's giving me more and more reasons to hit my curicculum hard! 

About 2 months ago, I found out I am pregnant again! Now that I am 14 weeks along, I am starting to feel more human and have more energy. I am doing lots of strength and stability exercises, hoping to keep the pain that I had last time at bay for as long as possible. We are absoluetly overjoyed for a second baby (who is due the same day that babe #1 was due), but we know it's going to be a long road. 

I am planning on still coding and learning as much as possible, as the past month we have learned that our job and industry is experiencing major budget cuts, and the next 6 months is going to be very iffy. I absolutely need to have a backup plan, and I believe that coding is the best option for me to have a great career. I want to do it for myself but to also show my little girl and the one on the way, that mamas can do awesome things in coding. I am also wanting to join mom coding groups to help keep me motivated. It helps to see other women out there being successful. 

Anyway, my only worry is timing this correctly. I do not want to finish before the baby is born, because no one is going to hire me with a growing pregnant belly (especially if it is like last time and I am practically disabled). I would love to be able to finish soon after the baby is born and jump into a job search then!  We will see how it goes. For now, I am just going to code while baby sleeps on weeknights, and as much as possible during the weekends (when I am not chasing down a crazy toddler.) Hopefully I will get far enough through the curicculum that I can be done close to when I would like. 

I am jumping back into loops. I believe I had trouble with this last time, so I am glad that I will be looking through it again and I am definitely going to take my time and make sure I understand it before moving on.
