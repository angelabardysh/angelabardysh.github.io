So my last blog, I was so excited becuase I was finally on a roll. I was doing my labs, and understanding everything pretty well. Well, I guess that life sometimes de-rails you when you least expect it. I am not saying I got de-railed in a bad way, it's actually pretty good, but I still feel like I am slowly losing steam, and I need to get back into the swing of things. 

So the reason that I started looking into learning code in the first place is because I had an amazing job, but I got laid off last December. My job was doing research for the oil and gas industry. It was work from home, and it was great money. I got laid off becuase prices were down too far to pay me to do research. I started looking into code becuase I wanted a job that was challenging, and something that wouldn't be the same every day. That is what my research job is to me. It is a job that has plenty of challenges, and takes lots of hard work and dedication to get things done correctly. 

Well, long story short, I got offered my job back a few weeks ago, and of course I had to take it. I had been waiting tables for the 11 months I was laid off in order to pay the bills, and even though it was great money and a super flexible schedule, it was definitely not the money I could make working from home. It was a no brainer to start work back up again. My husband was also offered the position and he took it as well, so we are both working from home, and it's awesome. 

You would think that since I got my old job back, that I would give up on coding. That is not the case. I am not going to give up. As much as I REALLY REALLY love my current job, I really don't know what the future holds for me in the field. It could go really great for a while, and then I could be suddenly out of a job a year from now. It all depends on the market- and seeing all of the awesome new technology in energy doesn't really have me scared, it just has me looking for other options for a long term career. 

That is why coding is so important to me. Not only do I think that I am really going to love it (especially when I start understanding it a little better), I know that my future is pretty set pursuing a career in code. My options are endless. I could even one day find a remote position once I have enough experience and work in my pajamas all day like I do now! 

Now that I have gotten back into the swing of things for work, I am going to try to step up my coding game. I am trying to set a goal of an average of 5 lessons per day. This may be hard on the weekdays, where I may only have an hour or two to work on learning at night, but my weekends, I should be able to easily hit that- especially after all of these holidays. 

I know that every blog I write, I keep saying that I will write something more techniqual next time, but next time, for real. I will try to write something more techniqal about what I have learned.
