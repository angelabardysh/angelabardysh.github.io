I can't even remember when I decided to join Flatiron, it's been that long. It was sometime before my first child was even a thought. I had high hopes of getting out of the restaurant industry and into a stable career. Well, as I was starting my journey to become a software engineer, I also found out I was pregnant and I got an amazing job offer I couldn't turn down. Eventually learning a new career skill ended up on the back burner while life went on full force. To my relief, the baby came, and we all started settling down into a new normal with life. 
Once she was a little over 1 year old, I decided that it was my time again to get back into code and try to change my career course. Sometimes life just laughs at your plans, and says "Hey, you thought one kid was hard... here comes another!". I was making great progress with my course, basically going back through what I had already done to refresh myself, and I felt like I was understanding it so much better this time. Eventually being pregnant, working full time, and having a toddler and a household to run just got too much to juggle with studying. 
Fast forward to now... We have an active and adorable two year old and we have our brand new three month old girl. 
My husband has decided that he wants to learn to code as well. We discussed it all, and with all that is going on (toddler, baby, full time work and a global pandemic), we decided that now is the time to skill up and it is urgent. Our work is very unstable, and although we are so lucky to have our jobs right now while 26 million Americans do not, we urgently need to skill up and pursue a career in software engineering. 
I KNOW that I can do it this time becuase we are doing it together. He has some background in coding, he took a Java bootcamp back in 2017. We want to do this together, and we are coding in every spare second that we have (with two littles, it's working out to be about 25-30 hours a week, while the girls sleep). I have complete faith that we are going to get through this course and get through it together. We are shooting to finish in January-ish, so about 9 months from now---- becoming a software engineer is our new baby. 
I can't wait to go back through all of the course to refresh my memory. We are almost through module three and I am feeling much better than both of the times I went through it before. I am optimistic about my journey this time, and I cannot wait to show my girls that mommy and daddy can do anything!
