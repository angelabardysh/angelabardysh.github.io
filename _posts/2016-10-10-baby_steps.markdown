When babies learn to walk, they fall down a LOT. After all that falling down, a baby doesn't think to itsself, "Baby, mabye this walking thing just isn't for me.". No, that baby just gets right back up and falls right back down on it's diaper padded butt a million more times. Then one day, when the baby's leg muscles have developed enough, she hits the ground running and never looks back. Somehow in the span of a day, she becomes faster than her parents, and zooms around wreacking havock everywhere she goes. 

That is how I feel on my coding journey. I am not going to give up. I still feel like a little baby, but I know that one day, it will all click, and I will forget about all the times I was discouraged in my learning. There have been a few times, where I have thought that maybe I am not smart enough, maybe I am just not cut out to learn code. But that is just silly. I know in my mind that I can do it. I can't give up. I am challenging myself to have the mentality of a baby. Just becuase all of the information is not "clicking" yet, does not mean it's not for me. It is going to take a lot of work to develop the experience I need to be successful. I CAN do this, and I WILL! 

For me, if something isn't clicking, I try to take steps backward to review information that my baby brain may have passed over the first time. It may seem like a simple little task, but this Tic Tac Toe game is challenging me. That is a good thing! 

I am starting to see how all of the methods work together to create a flowing game of Tic Tac Toe. I am stuck at the moment on a turn method. In this method I need to know who's turn it is on the board, X or O. While I thought about it, at first I thought that an X would be an even number and O would be an odd number. I was thinking of it in terms of user input, but then I had a revelation. It wouldn't be in terms of user input- it would be in terms of the number of turns of the board. Even being X and odd being O. The user input 1-9, is the spot on the board they want to place their token. I am taking the time now to go back and review some more, finding everything I can to help me make a method that counts board turns, and converts it into which token should be played at the moment.

So this is where I am on my coding journey at the moment. My muscles are sore, but they are getting stronger each day. Pretty soon, this will all be history, and I will be coding in a new career. I can't wait for that to start, but I've gotta take baby steps first.
