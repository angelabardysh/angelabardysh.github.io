My last blog entry was quite optimistic, it seems. Life just has a great way of throwing curve balls, and sometimes all you can do is just deal with it, and try to tread above the water. 

My last blog post was dated in the first week of September 2017. I was 20 weeks pregnant, and thought that I was over my hump of the first terrible trimester of pregnancy. Boy, was I WRONG. My pregnancy was pretty terrible, and 20 weeks was just the start, with each week getting worse and worse. Learning to code really flew out the window, especially since I was now consumed with a terribly painful pregnancy complication called SPD (you can google it if you'd like, but to put it in plain terms, every time I moved my legs, it felt l ike my pelvis was literally going to shatter.) Thankfully, the cure for my complication, was having the baby, which happened on January 12, 2018. My sweet baby girl gave me a run for my money in pregnancy, but she has been literally the best baby in the real world. She is now 15 months old and running around, and I am FINALLY feeling close to my pre-pregnancy self again. 

2018 was probably the craziest year I have ever had in my life. We had our baby, moved across Michigan from Detroit to Grand Rapids, and then, completely unexpectedly, I was offered a promotion, with the catch that we had to move to Alabama. This was NOT in our plans even remotely. So we picked up and moved across the country, got settled, and bought a house. We also snuck in a trip to Italy to visit my husband's parents, so they could meet the baby, and so I could meet them for the first time (We've been married 10 years!) After this crazy year, I am ready to calm down, stay in one place, and invest time in myself to learn something that could lead to a rewarding career. (My current job is amazing, but not the most reliable industry, so I need to have a back up plan to fall on at any second.)

Now that baby is a little older,  I feel *somewhat* like I have the hang of things (being a new mom, being in a new city).  I feel like I can get back into my coding journey. So here I go. I am hoping to dedicate 10-15 hours a week at this, moving at my own pace, while also dedicating time to my family and still working full time. I HIGHLY doubt that I remember anything from this course that I completed previously, so I am going to start at the beginning, and work my way through. So here's to learning some code... and maybe having a glass of wine!
