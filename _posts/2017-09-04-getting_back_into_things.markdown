Well it has been a while. What was only meant to be a small break from coding turned into quite a few months. Back in February/March, my husband and I decided that we wanted to move to Michigan, so we got to work on getting our house ready to sell! Between working full time and preparing our house for sale and finding a new place to live in a new state, learning code took the back burner. I promised myself that once we got settled into our new place, that I would resume. Life had other plans. 

We moved to a city right outside of Detroit, because we have heard that Detroit is an up and coming tech city, and we want to get in on it while it's still young, fresh and developing. Our official move date was May 13th, so we packed up our truck and our friends met us at our new rental house. We spent the next few days unpacking. On May 17th, we found out (to our SURPRISE) that we are expecting a baby. 

Soooooo many changes in so little time. We went from living in Nashville, to living in Michigan and expecting our first child within just a few days. This was a shock for us, especially since a kid really wasn't in our plan. 

I am now almost 20 weeks along, and it has been fairly rough. I definitely have not felt like myself this whole time. I have hardly had enough energy just to complete my work daily, let alone concentrate on learning code. I am starting to feel more human again, and I want to slowly ease back into learning code. There is no rush on finishing this course for me though at the moment. Who is going to hire someone who is about to have a baby? I want to work at coding over the next 4.5 months, so that I am finishing this course close to when I am ready to enter back into the work force. 

So here I am. I am about to start reviewing some of the information, because to be honest, I was a little lost when I took a break, and I need to freshen up. I am so thankful for the flexibility of Flatiron right now. That I was able to take such a long break and now I am free to pick up where I feel comfortable and get started again. 

So here is to my coding journey starting back up. I am hoping to be able to push through and be able to have a new career sometime next year after our baby girl is born.
